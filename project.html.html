    <!--  About project -->
    <p>Our project, <strong>Webz</strong>, is a web application designed to help small business owners 
    access government funding. After registering, business owners provide proof of address and other required 
    documents. The application then sends this information to the government for approval, and the results 
    are sent back to the business owner. Webz simplifies and speeds up the funding process, making it easier 
    for small businesses to grow and thrive.</p>
